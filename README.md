# Titanic Survival


The goals of this repository are:
1. Participate in the Titanic Competition in Kaggle;
2. Explore the Kaggle Titantic train dataset using R;
3. Create a full ML pipeline (end-to-end) in Python using cross-validation for model selection, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning;
4. Predict Survival in the Titanic disaster using Kaggle's Titanic test set and the Python ML pipeline.
